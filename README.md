# Moodify

This project is aimed at analysing lyrics of songs and classifying them as ‘happy’ or ‘sad’. We used Python’s Natural Language ToolKit to remove stopwords and to perform stemming. We also used a TF-IDF Vectorizer to ensure more meaningful words are given more weight. The final classifier was trained using the Support Vector Machines implementation of scikit-learn.
